# chocofi temper

This is a split, wireless-only mechanical keyboard fashioned after the [chocofi keyboard](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi). It started as a simple modification of the original chocofi PCBs to include battery pads and power switches for wireless use, but in the end, I thought there were enough changes to warrant giving it a separate designation. However, this design remains compatible with chocofi cases and plates.

## Features

- 36-key split keyboard with 3 rows x 5 columns + 3 thumb keys per half
- Kailh choc spacing
- Sweep-like column stagger
- Reversible PCB (so one design can be used for both halves)
- Kailh choc hotswap sockets
- Intended to be used with [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano)
- Uses 7-pin SPDT power switch and includes pads for battery on keyboard shield PCB
- Support for [nice!view](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-view), though this hasn't been tested yet
- Compatible with chocofi cases and plates

## Why "temper"?

Tempering is a finicky process that changes the structure of chocolate to make it more shiny, but doesn't really change the taste much.

Likewise, the changes I made to the chocofi didn't alter the original design much, but made some quality-of-life improvements for both development and my own personal aesthetics, at the cost of removing traditional wired operation and possibly making it more difficult to assemble, given the addition of many solder jumpers. 

## Similar keyboards

There are many similar keyboards to this one and the chocofi, and I'm sure they've all taken inspiration from each other at one point or another. Here's a (surely incomplete) list:
